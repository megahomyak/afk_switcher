What?
-----

This is a utility that changes the OBS scene to "AFK" when the taskbar icon is
clicked and changes it back when the cursor is moved. An ancestor of
`obs_scene_switcher`_.

Why?
----

Because I keep forgetting to switch the scene back with `obs_scene_switcher`_.
Also, `obs_scene_switcher`_ made it impossible for me to create more than two
scenes ("Main" and "AFK"), since it switched to the next scene instead of going
forward and back (like this script does).

How?
----

Instruction is the same as in `obs_scene_switcher`_, except that it only
switches to the scene named "AFK" and switches back when the cursor is moved.
Also, the script name is obviously different.
