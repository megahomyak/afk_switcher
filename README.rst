What?
-----

This is a utility that changes the OBS scene to "AFK" when the taskbar icon is
clicked and changes it back when the cursor is moved. An ancestor of
`obs_scene_switcher`_.

Why?
----

Because I keep forgetting to switch the scene back with `obs_scene_switcher`_.

How?
----

Instruction is the same as in `obs_scene_switcher`_, except that it only
switches to the scene named "AFK" and switches back when the cursor is moved.
